# Linux, Exfiltration and Escalation Of Privilege Lab
Incident Response lab fully created by myself - covers creating a Linux vm, creating storage container in Azure, basic linux commands, script writing, creating rules in MDE, report writing, and more. 


**Scenario**: A Company has been noticing some PII information might be getting leaked because of recent phishing attempts. Such information includes address, email address, and phone number. All of this information is stored on a linux server as a hidden file where only the root/sudo users have read and write access. There was a report by another employee the other day of a fellow employee messing with the computer while the root administrator was in the bathroom. The company has decided to investigate this. 

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Azure Blob Storage
